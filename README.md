As of now (11/06/2023) I have gathered 7184 complete games from cEDH tournaments ran with Command Tower software from [Eminence](https://topdeck.gg/).

I will share some stuff about here, but take a look at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/datatog) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Datatog) where I post most of my stuff.
